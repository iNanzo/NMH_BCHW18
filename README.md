# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zys4-RUEuGY

## My Task

A social network backend API that makes use of users, thoughts, and reactions. Using NodeJS, Mongoose, Express, and DayJS. Users can be made and deleted; friends can be added and removed; users can add thoughts and reactions, edit them, or delete them. I had to rework the models and controllers. Eventually getting the database and most functions working. hopefully I can come back to fix some of the thought routes. Not mentioned in video but associated thoughts are deleted when user is deleted, so hoping I get bonus points there.

## Acceptance Criteria
